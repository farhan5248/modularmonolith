Splitting up a monolith into a [modular monolith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OjqD-ow8GE) (before going to micro-services) was the original technical problem I was trying to solve.
It's when the QA team gave the estimate of double the coding efforts that I went off on a tangent to understand why are QA teams the way they are.

I currently have some examples of how this would be done once a QA team works a certain way but I'm taking a break.
Once I'm done with porting over the Xtext plug-in to VS Code and integrating it with AI I'll come back to this.

I'll try to mimic the structure of [Learn Microservices with Spring Boot](https://mosy.tech/products-overview/) but from the perspective of QA.
I'll develop examples of how to generate the mock services or data using the REST API.
